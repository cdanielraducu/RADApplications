Deepstash is a platform where users read and curate bite-sized insights and ideas from anywhere online, may that be books, articles, podcasts, or videos.

I've worked at this client for almost 2 years. My first job actually. Learned a lot. Started with React-Native, developing the main mobile-app. And after a I've switched between web and mobile. Great experience. Passionate colleagues which gave me the ropes. Thankful for this experience. I recommend using the app, it is quite cool if you want to get smarter every day!
